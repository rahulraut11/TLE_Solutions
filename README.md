## 📂 Folder & File Structure

```
.
├── 800_Rated/        # 800-rated problems (mostly written in C)
├── template.cpp      # My C++ starter template
├── README.md         # This file
```

- ✅ Problems rated **800** are mostly solved in **C**
- ✅ All other are solved in **C++**
- ✅ File naming is simple and follows a numeric or structured naming convention
